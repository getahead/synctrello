        <h3 className="page__block-question">How does the syncing work?</h3>
        <p>
          SyncTrello gets notifications about changes on your board. We match a bound card and apply changes for it.
          The whole process usually takes less than a second.
        </p>

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">How do bindings create?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>SyncTrello</strong> gets notifications on copy card actions and create a binding.
          You can also create a binding manually in your <Link to="/profile/cards">dashboard</Link>.
          If you prefer the manual binding creation to the automatic,
          you can always switch between modes in your settings.

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">What kind of data do we store on our servers?</h3>
        <p>
          SyncTrello stores only your Trello userId, username, list of boards and your email. It also needs ids of paired cards for making bindings. We do not even store cardâ€™s body or history.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">What kind of data does SyncTrello synchronise?</h3>
        <p>
          SyncTrello can sync cardnames, cards descriptions, due dates.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">What are one-way and double-ways bindings?</h3>
        <p>
          In double-ways bindings cards sync in both sides. In one-way bindings cards synchronise only by one direction.
          You can switch between the binding modes for each of a pair you created in your <Link to="/profile/cards">cards list</Link>.
          You are also allowed to set default binding mode for new pairs in your settings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">Can I disable creating bindings by other users?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you can set it in your settings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="page__block">
        <h3 className="page__block-question">Can I create chains of cards?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but be careful. We do not limit chains size and We are not responsible for the cards in your chains.
